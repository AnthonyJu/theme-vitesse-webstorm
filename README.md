<h1 align="center">Vitesse WebStorm Dark Theme</h1>

Vitesse WebStorm Dark is a dark theme designed for Visual Studio Code, inspired by the color scheme of WebStorm and Vitesse. The background is close to the dark theme of WebStorm, and the code color scheme refers to Vitesse's color scheme, but increases brightness and contrast.
